# Voice Enabled Task Tracker

The Voice-Enabled Task Tracker is a full-stack productivity application built to create, manage, and track tasks using natural language voice commands. The frontend is developed with React.js, styled using TailwindCSS, and integrates the React Speech Recognition library to convert spoken input into structured task data such as title, priority, due date, and status.

On the backend, the application uses Node.js and Express.js to provide a clean REST API for CRUD operations. All task data is stored securely in MongoDB, ensuring fast, scalable, and reliable data persistence.

This project demonstrates seamless integration of voice processing, natural-language extraction, intuitive UI design, and modern API-driven architecture.
